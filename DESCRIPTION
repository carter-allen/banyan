Description: Allows for network-based Bayesian analysis of spatially resolved single cell data. The core model is an extension of the stochastic block model (SBM) to integration of spatial and gene expression cell-cell similarity network. The package allows for robust detection of cell sub-populations and interaction among them using a Bayesian probabilistic framework. Numerous visualization functions are included for interpretation of results.
